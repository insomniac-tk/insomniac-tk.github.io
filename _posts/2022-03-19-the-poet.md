That darn blinking cursor on his word processor made him nauseous  
Hunched over his laptop,from the dusk to dawn  
He read his new piece and was too exhausted to only mumble ‘atrocious’  
His eyes filling up with water, nose running and his back was sore  
He went back to the drawing board  
  
He wanted to pour his heart and soul, let it all out  
But  his muse had aged and rusted  
All his tried and tested methods were busted  
He couldn’t allow himself to become frustrated and flustered  

So he dusted himself off  
And mustered  his will, the remnants thereof   
And wanted to be in the body of the same man whose words   
Were fraught with unparalleled passion and grit  

Believing that he can still instill awe   
And bring Space and Time to a standstill  
He took one last leap of faith  
With his quill and spartan will   
  
He felt an inkling, a gut feeling, that a new idea was a-coming   
Akin to a cheetah who has been waiting in the bushes for hours  
He was ready to pounce and jump on it  
A new rhyme, he could already conjure it   

Groping around his mind for ideas here and yonder  
He had finally cornered it  
And he wasn’t the agent, he felt like a mere conduit  
Allowing the inspiration to flow through  
Oh so effortless and so smooth  

Alas, like romance after marriage, it faded away eventually  
Until it became a mere shadow somewhere in his psyche  
A self-created illusion which was a dead end , most likely  
A mirage in his mind which was now a desert   
Dry, Desolate and Dingy   

He felt excruciating pangs of pain  
Realizing he had let himself be fooled yet again  
He looked at himself with utter contempt and disdain  
He sought refuge by drowning himself in his past  

His previous bestsellers, boy, he’d say, they sold so fast  
Surrounded by his old poems  
They were strewn about him like corpses  
For the mind that brought them to life was now dead
