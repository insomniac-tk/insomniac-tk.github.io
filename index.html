<h1>Hi there! &#128075;</h1>
<h2>Welcome to my blog!</h2>
<article>
    I’m a software engineer with a demonstrable ability to think critically and rise to occasions when
    I need to venture into unexplored fields of research. I am a team player who enjoys brainstorming ideas and 
    someone who doesn’t shy away from difficult problems. With a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms along with machine learning and data science , I strive my best to leverage the best of both software engineering and machine learning to solve challenging problems.
