    My name is Tejas Khanna, and these are some random facts about me:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>I was born in the city of Ahmedabad in the western state of Gujarat in India.</li>
    <li>I am a native speaker of Hindi and have a near-native proficiency in English. 
        According to CEFR, I am a basic user of French as well(A2). Along with these three, 
        I can hold basic conversations in Gujarati as well(the official language of Gujarat.)
    </li>
    <li>The first computer program that I remember writing printed "hello world" and this
        happened around my 11th year in school, 2014. The language used was C++.
    </li>
    <li>
        I have read about 18 books so far. Some of my favourites are (ranked in no particular order) :
        <ol>
            <li>	
            One Two Three . . . Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science , by George Gamov</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Thus Spake Zarathustra by Friedrich  Nietzsche(pronounced as Knee-Che)
            </li>
            <li>A Brief History of Time by Prof. Stephen Hawking</li>
            <li>The Stranger by Albert Camus</li>
            <li> 	
                Red Dragon by Thomas Harris
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

        I had some of the most memorable experiences of my life in the 14 years(Jr. Kg - Year 12)
        that I spent at Delhi Public School, Bopal. If I had to go back and do it all again, I'd 
        without a doubt(with some changes)
    </li>
    <li> My first love, speaking in terms of a field or discipline was of Science,
        I was fascinated by Scientists, wanted to be one 
        since I first learnt about them from one of my first books 'Great Scientists of the World' in Year 4.
        But, due to a host of reasons some known to me and others unknown to this day, I picked up Computer Science
        as my major for my undergraduate degree(B.E.) at Gandhinagar Institute of Techonology.
        I guess there was something about computer science that won me over and it changed 
        the course of my life from that point onwards. 
    </li>
    <li> 
        I enjoy writing poems. The craft of making 'rhymes', 
        so to speak, never ceased to amaze me. I don't remeber the exact age when I started, 
        but as far as I look back, I remember scriibling rhymes in notebooks. 
    </li>
    <li> 
        My playlist comprises of music from: Eminem, Dr. Dre, Straight Outta Compton,
        Ludwig Van Beethoven, Antonio Vivaldi, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Ice Cube, Lil Wayne, Jay Z, 
        Richar Strauss(Also Sprach Zarathustra!!), OSTs, a few french singles and 
        a smattering of some old pop/metal/rock.
    </li>
</ul>
